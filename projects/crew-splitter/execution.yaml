          Take an existing execution.yaml file with many tasks and rearrange it into several crews with one task in each crew.
          This will facilitate parallel processing and generate an output artifact for each task.

        description: >
          Ask a human to provide an execution.yaml file and analyze its structure to identify all the tasks.
          Create a new execution.yaml structure where each task is assigned to a separate crew.
          Ensure that each crew has the necessary information and structure to execute the task independently.
          Write the new execution.yaml file to the system.
        expected_output: >
          A new execution.yaml file where each task from the original file is now managed by a separate crew,
          allowing for individual task processing and output generation.

          The execution.yaml shall be complete with all the necessary information for each crew to execute their tasks.
          Don't truncate any section or use placeholders. Ensure that the new file is well-structured and ready for execution.
