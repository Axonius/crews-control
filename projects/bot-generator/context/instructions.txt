- The provided example in the context is for a specific bot. You need to customize it for {bot_name}.
- Ensure that the `execution.yaml` file is according to the structure of the provided example.
- If you need to reference the output of a dependant crew in another crew's task, enclose the templating variable using a unique relevant marker like so:
  [SOME_REASONABLE_UNIQUE_MARKER]
  {the_referenced_crew_you_want_their_output}
  [/SOME_REASONABLE_UNIQUE_MARKER]
- You need to decide on how many crews (could be 1 or more), how many agents in each crew, and the tasks for each agent.
- Prefer more crews as opposed to a single crew with many tasks, as that would allow collecting intermediate outputs.
- You need to decide on the tools required for each agent and the tasks.
- Available tools are [serper, human, website_search, github] - you can choose any combination of these tools.
- - serper: is used to search the internet for information.
- - human: is used to engage with a human for information.
- - website_search: is used to search in a specific website.
- - github: is used to search in a specific github repository.
- - The provided example was for a specific bot that had to do such research,
- - but a {bot_name} may need to perform completely different tasks!
- You need to decide if the bot needs to have multiple crews or just a single crew
- If more than 1 crew is needed, you need to decide if there are dependencies between crews.
- You can decide on the agents and their roles, goals, tools, and backstory.
- tasks don't have tools. Tools are only assigned to agents.
- The Research Analyst, Job Description Writer and Review and Editing Specialist roles in the example is just an example. You can choose any roles for any number of agents.
- if you get inputs from the user, you can use them in descriptions, expected outputs, etc. by enclosing them in curly braces.
- ensure that expected_output is per task and not per crew.
- ensure that every task has an expected_output.
